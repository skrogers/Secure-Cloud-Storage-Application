  3) From the projects list on the top bar next to Google Cloud Platform Title, select a        project or create a new one.
  4) If making a new one, give it a name and select location. If you are getting an option for organisation, select the valid organisation and click create.
  5) If the APIs & services page isn't already open, open the console left side menu and select APIs & services.
  6) On the left, click Credentials. Inside that select Create Credentials.
  7) Click New Credentials, then select OAuth client ID.
  8) Then it will ask you to configure Consent Screen. Do that.

  10) Then write Application Name, followed by User supported Email. Again add email in Developer contact information.
  11) Then Save and Continue. Leave all the other options to their default values and go ahead clicking on  “SAVE AND CONTINUE“.
  12) Then Select back to Dashboard.
  13) On the left, click Credentials. Inside that select Create Credentials. Then select OAuth client ID.
  14) It will ask application type. Select yours. This is a Desktop App. Give a name.
  15) Click on create and an OAuth client will be created.
